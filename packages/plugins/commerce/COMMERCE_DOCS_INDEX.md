# Commerce plugin documentation index

## Operations and support

For a quick reviewer entrypoint: `@THIRD_PARTY_REVIEW_PACKAGE.md` → `external_review.md` → `SHARE_WITH_REVIEWER.md`.

### Pre-merge release gates (review-response work)

- `pnpm --silent lint:quick` (repo-level quick lint)
- `pnpm --filter ./packages/plugins/commerce typecheck` (required plugin scope)
- `pnpm --filter ./packages/plugins/commerce test` (required plugin scope)
- `pnpm --filter ./packages/core typecheck` (optional full-core guardrail; known baseline typing debt is tracked in core)
- `HANDOVER.md` + external feedback checklist updated for each completed item
- Capture commit hash + summary before handoff

- Latest automated proof for this pass:
  - `pnpm --silent lint:quick` ✅
  - `pnpm --filter ./packages/plugins/commerce typecheck` ✅
  - `pnpm --filter ./packages/plugins/commerce test` ✅
  - `pnpm --filter ./packages/core typecheck` ❌ (pre-existing non-commerce core typing debt)

### Strategy A (Contract Drift Hardening) status

**Strategy A metadata**

- Last updated: 2026-04-03
- Owner: emDash Commerce plugin lead (handoff-ready docs update)
- Current phase owner: Strategy A follow-up only
- Status in this branch: 5A (same-event duplicate-flight concurrency assertions), 5B (pending-state resume-state visibility and non-terminal branch behavior), 5C (possession boundary assertions), 5D (scope lock reaffirmed), 5E (deterministic claim lease/expiry policy), and 5F (strict claim-lease proof artifacts captured).

- Scope: **active for this iteration only** and **testable without new provider runtime**.
- Goal: keep `checkout`/`webhook` behavior unchanged while reducing contract drift across payment adapters.
- Constraint: no broader provider runtime refactor yet.
- Activation guardrail: defer provider- and MCP-command architecture work until either:
  - a second payment provider is actively onboarded, or
  - an `@emdash-cms/plugin-dashing-commerce-mcp` command surface is shipped.
- Relevant files:
  - `src/services/commerce-provider-contracts.ts`
  - `src/services/commerce-provider-contracts.test.ts`

## Plugin code references

- `package.json` — package scripts and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config
- `src/services/` and `src/orchestration/` — extension seams and finalize logic
- `src/handlers/` — route handlers (cart, checkout, webhooks, catalog)
- `src/orchestration/` — finalize orchestration and inventory/attempt updates
- `src/catalog-extensibility.ts` — kernel rules + extension seam contracts
- `src/storage.ts` — storage collection declarations (products/skus added for v1 catalog)
- `src/types.ts` and `src/schemas.ts` — catalog domain models and validation

### Ticket starter: Strategy A (contract hardening)

Use this when opening follow-up work:

1) Set scope to Strategy A only (contract drift hardening, no topology change).
2) Execute the Strategy A checklist in `CI_REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md` sections 0–5, with optional 5F follow-through.
3) Confirm docs updates are in scope:
   - `COMMERCE_DOCS_INDEX.md`
   - `COMMERCE_EXTENSION_SURFACE.md`
   - `AI-EXTENSIBILITY.md`
   - `HANDOVER.md`
   - `FINALIZATION_REVIEW_AUDIT.md`
4) Run proof commands:
   - `pnpm --filter @emdash-cms/plugin-dashing-commerce test services/commerce-provider-contracts.test.ts`
   - `pnpm --filter @emdash-cms/plugin-dashing-commerce test`
5) Proof artifacts for strict lease rollout:
  - `COMMERCE_USE_LEASED_FINALIZE` is retained for replay parity and evidence reruns when needed; strict claim-lease checks are otherwise canonical.
  - Runbooks and proof outputs are now captured directly in this repo’s regression log trail.

## External review continuation roadmap

After the latest third-party memo, continue systematically with
`CI_REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md` sections 5A–5F (in order) before broadening
provider topology.
5A/5B/5C/5D/5E/5F have been implemented in this branch.
Strict lease behavior is now canonical and evidence is maintained in current strategy and regression docs.

For post-5F planning, follow `COMMERCE_AI_ROADMAP.md` as the optional
reliability-support-catalog extension backlog.

## Plugin HTTP routes

| `checkout/get-order` | Read-only order snapshot; always requires matching `finalizeToken`                               |

| `catalog/product/create` | Validate and create a product row                                                                |
| `catalog/product/get`    | Retrieve one product by id                                                                        |

| `catalog/sku/create`     | Create a SKU for an existing product                                                               |
| `catalog/sku/list`       | List SKUs for one product                                                                         |

## Diagnostics and runbook surfaces

- `queryFinalizationState` (via `src/services/commerce-extension-seams.ts`) for runbook and MCP reads — applies per-IP rate limit, ~10s KV cache, and in-isolate in-flight coalescing (see `COMMERCE_LIMITS` / `finalization-diagnostics-readthrough.ts`).
- `queryFinalizationStatus` (via `src/orchestration/finalize-payment.ts`) returns the same shape but **without** those guards; prefer `queryFinalizationState` for HTTP/MCP polling unless you are in a controlled test or internal path.

All routes mount under `/_emdash/api/plugins/dashing-commerce/<route>`.

Implementation note: `src/index.ts` is the active source of truth for what the plugin exposes over HTTP today.
