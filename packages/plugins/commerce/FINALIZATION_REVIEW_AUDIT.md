# Finalization Receipt State and Replay Audit

Use this as the single audit artifact for recovery-path behavior in
`finalizePaymentFromWebhook()`.

## 1) Receipt-state exits after pending write

After `webhookReceipts.put(receiptId, { status: "pending", ... })`, every branch
must resolve to one of three outcomes:

- **`TERMINAL_ERROR`**: do not auto-retry on operator-triggered follow-up.
- **`RESUMABLE_PENDING`**: keep `pending` and retrying the same event should
  continue safely.
- **`COMPLETED`**: write `processed` and return success.

| Branch after pending write                                                      | Receipt status     | Why this outcome                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Re-read of order fails (`post_pending_lookup`)                                  | `error`            | The order row is gone; this is a terminal integrity signal for investigation.                                                          |
| Order no longer finalizable (`paymentPhase` not `payment_pending`/`authorized`) | `error`            | Concurrency or external mutation moved state; retrying blindly is unsafe.                                                              |
| Inventory preflight fails (version mismatch, insufficient stock, etc.)          | `pending`          | Side effects were intentionally not applied; retry can safely retry from scratch using same event context.                             |
| Order persistence fails (`orders.put` failure during finalization)              | `pending`          | Inventory may be applied, but payment-phase transition is incomplete; retry is expected.                                               |
| Payment attempt persistence fails (`paymentAttempts.put` failure)               | `pending`          | Order may be paid, but attempt state is incomplete; retry is expected.                                                                 |
| Finalization writes succeed, but `webhookReceipts.put(processed)` fails         | `pending` (throws) | Caller receives a transport error; a retried call continues from the same idempotent state and should now complete receipt processing. |
| Full success path                                                               | `processed`        | Terminal success; subsequent replay returns `replay` semantics where appropriate.                                                      |

## 1b) Log events for recovery tooling

Preferred operational events:

- `commerce.finalize.receipt_pending`
- `commerce.finalize.order_not_found`
- `commerce.finalize.order_not_finalizable`
- `commerce.finalize.inventory_reconcile`
- `commerce.finalize.inventory_applied`
- `commerce.finalize.inventory_failed`
- `commerce.finalize.order_settlement_attempt`
- `commerce.finalize.payment_attempt_update_attempt`
- `commerce.finalize.receipt_processed`
- `commerce.finalize.completed`

## 1c) 5E/5F lease enforcement follow-through

`finalizePaymentFromWebhook()` applies strict lease boundary checks as the default behavior:

- malformed or missing `claimExpiresAt` is treated as replay-safe (`claim_retry_failed`) instead of silently continuing side-effect writes,
- finalization remains bounded by live claim validation before each mutable write stage (`inventory`, `order`, `attempt`, `receipt`),
- strict mode still allows reclaim of valid stale claims (`now > claimExpiresAt`) and preserves in-flight lock semantics.
- claim lease width is `WEBHOOK_RECEIPT_CLAIM_WINDOW_MS` by default, and `claimLeaseWindowMs` is available on
  `finalizePaymentFromWebhook(...)` for deterministic testing.
- in-progress claims are proactively refreshed at guarded checkpoints so a long finalize path can retain ownership across
  the full write sequence when the initial lease would otherwise expire.

Operational evidence for this stage is recorded in the current strategy and regression
checklists as active proof trails.

## 1d) Atomic claim capability prerequisites

- `webhookReceipts` must expose `putIfAbsent` and `compareAndSwap` for finalized webhook calls.
- If either capability is unavailable, `finalizePaymentFromWebhook()` returns
  `api_error: ATOMIC_STORAGE_REQUIRED` and does not start side effects.
- `src/orchestration/finalize-payment.test.ts` includes dedicated coverage to assert that
  missing atomic support is rejected before receipt claim attempts.

## 2) Duplicate delivery & partial-failure replay matrix

| Scenario                                                                              | Expected outcome                                                             | Why it is safe today                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicate webhook event with same `(providerId, externalEventId)` in a shared runtime | Idempotent or replay-like behavior (status transitions + deterministic IDs). | Existing receipt key (`webhookReceiptDocId`) is stable; ledger/order writes are deterministic.                   |
| Same event replay while previous attempt is still `pending`                           | Resume from `pending` state; side effects remain bounded.                    | Decision/receipt/query logic is deterministic and keyed by the same event id.                                    |
| Partial failure after some side effects (inventory/order/attempt)                     | Receipt stays `pending` unless missing/non-finalizable order case.           | In-progress state is preserved and documented for safe retry.                                                    |
| Perfectly concurrent cross-worker delivery                                            | Residual risk remains bounded.                                               | Claim ownership now uses lease metadata plus ownership-version checks; safe revalidation points can short-circuit writes before side effects, but platform-specific timing around concurrent updates is still a residual watchpoint. |
