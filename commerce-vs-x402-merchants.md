# Commerce vs x402 — quick guide for merchants

EmDash can power **two different payment stories**. They solve different jobs. You can use **one, the other, or both** on the same site; they are not duplicates of each other.

## At a glance

| | **DashingCommerce** *(cart / checkout plugin)* | **x402** *(`@emdash-cms/x402`)* |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **What it’s for** | Selling **products or services** with a **cart**, **checkout**, **orders**, and (when configured) **cards** via payment providers | **HTTP-native, pay-per-request** access — often for **content**, **APIs**, or **agent** traffic using **402 Payment Required** |
| **Typical buyer** | Humans shopping on your storefront | Automated clients (AI agents, bots) or any client that speaks x402; can be combined with “humans free, bots pay” |
| **Mental model** | “I run a **shop**” | “I charge **per access** to a URL or resource” |
| **Cart & line items** | Yes — multiple items, quantities, variants | No — each paid request is its own transaction |
| **Order history & fulfillment** | Yes — orders, statuses, emails, operations *(as the plugin ships)* | No — it gates access; there is no built-in “order” object like a store |
| **Inventory & stock** | Yes — core concern for physical / limited digital goods | Not applicable — no SKU catalog |
| **Shipping & tax** | Supported via **separate modules** when you need real quotes and addresses | Not applicable |
| **How payment feels** | Familiar **checkout** (redirect, card form, wallet, depending on provider) | Client receives **402** + instructions, pays, **retries** the request with proof of payment |
| **Best fit** | T-shirts, courses, licenses, donations with amounts, anything with a **catalog** | Articles, feeds, APIs, “charge scrapers/agents,” **micropayments** per view or call |
| **Same site?** | Yes | Yes — e.g. **store** uses Commerce; **blog or API** uses x402 |

## Simple decision rule

- Choose **Commerce** when buyers pick **products**, you need **carts**, **orders**, or **inventory**.
- Choose **x402** when you want **automatic, request-level payment** (especially for **machines** or **per-access** pricing) without building a shop.

When in doubt: **shop-shaped problem → Commerce. Gate-shaped problem → x402.**
